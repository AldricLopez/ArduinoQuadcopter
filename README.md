# ArduinoQuadcopter
Quadcopter controller based on Arduino. Currently only supporting X configuration and specific hardware.

##Hardware Required
The costum built controller uses the following sensors connected to an Atmega328 with Arduino bootloader

-Accelerometer	ADXL345 
-Gyroscope		L3G4200D 
-Magnetometer	HMC5883L
-Barometer      BMP085

##PC Software
There is also a pc software available to monitor the controller and change PID constants. This software is made with Processing.
